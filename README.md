# A little bit of theory and exercises for practicing for a coding interview :boom:

Some `Python` code to study and practice for a coding interview. The content of the repo is divided in two: a theory part, in which each topic is explained by a pseudo-algorithm and then it's `Python` implementation, and a excercise (or practice) part, in which there are a set of problems and answers for each topic.

## Areas covered

The computer science topics addressed in this repo are:

- Algorithms and complexity (sorting and seaching).
- Trees
- Graphs
- Other data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues)
- Recursion
- OS (pending)

## Installing and running

Just clone the repo, access to the folder you want and run the code you want to test :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ClementeSerrano/cracking-coding-interview.git
$ cd cracking-coding-interview
$ cd [THEORY OR PRACTICE]
$ python3 [FILE YOU WANT TO TEST]
```
